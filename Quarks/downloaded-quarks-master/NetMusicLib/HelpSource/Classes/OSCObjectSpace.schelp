DESCRIPTION::
Sync simple data types between Peers. Unlike OSCDataSpace it supports more than just OSC data types. It functions similarly to a link::Classes/IdentityDictionary:: in its basic operation (i.e. you can use at and put)

SECTION::Important Issues when using OSCObjectSpace
LIST::
##Only objects which can be archived (i.e. those that do not contain open functions) can be sent
##OSCObjectSpace does not track internal changes in the objects it holds. You can set the key again with the changed object, but this will result in a new object being made in other Peer's object spaces, not the old one being changed. If you want to sync changes to remote objects the OpenObject quark might be better.
##OSCObjectSpace can constitute a  EMPHASIS::security risk::, since a malicious party could insert a pseudo-object spoofing something else. For this reason, by default it does not accept Events, although you can enable that. For safety it is best to use it on a secure network, and with encryption. If auto-discovering peers on an open network, the use of an autheniticator such as ChallengeAuthenticator can provide additional security.

CLASSMETHODS::

METHOD:: new
(describe method here)

ARGUMENT:: addrBook
an AddrBook where Peers are registered

ARGUMENT:: acceptEvents
A Boolean indicating whether Events are permitted in this OSCObjectSpace.

ARGUMENT:: oscPath
the oscPath to use when relaying

ARGUMENT:: encryptor
an (optional) encryptor for sending objects

returns:: a new OSCObjectSpace


INSTANCEMETHODS::

private::updatePeers, makeOSCFunc, sync, validateArchive, init, put

METHOD:: getPairs
Get pairwise keys and values

returns:: Return an link::Classes/Array:: with all keys and values pairwise.

METHOD:: acceptEvents
Get or set a link::Classes/Boolean:: indicating whether this OSCObjectSpace accepts Events. Changing this will not purge any currently stored Events.

returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean::

METHOD:: validate
Get or set a link::Classes/Boolean:: indicating whether this OSCObjectSpace validates received objects by searching for particular high risk strings (unixCmd, systemCmd, Pipe, File). Objects which do not pass validation are rejected. The default is true.

returns:: a link::Classes/Boolean::


EXAMPLES::

code::
// assumes ~addrBook contains the appropriate Peers
// here we will share some arbitrary objects
// OSCObjectSpace makes local copies of archivable objects stored remotely (see notes below)
~objSpace = OSCObjectSpace(~addrBook, oscPath:'/someObjs');


// post a message when a new object comes
// you could use this to update other objects, etc.
(
~objSpace.addDependant({|objectSpace, what, key, val|
	"New object for key %: %\n".postf(key, val);
});
)

// now add some stuff
~objSpace[\point] = 2@3;

// your friends should see it
~objSpace[\point]

// somebody change it
~objSpace[\point] = ">>>>>>>";
